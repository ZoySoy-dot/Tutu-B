                    <p class="Article_Section_Paragraph">
                        <strong>Welcome to tutu-B</strong>, the official digital magazine of STEM 11-B from De La Salle University – Laguna Campus. This publication was created with the intention of sharing our ideas, voices, and efforts as students who are passionate about science, technology, and the world around us.
                        <br><br>
                      
                        <strong>tutu-B began as a class project</strong>, but it quickly became something much more meaningful. It started with a vision to build a platform where we could express ourselves freely, showcase what we have learned, and create something that reflects our growth as individuals and as a community. The process involved more than just writing and research. It was about collaboration, trust, and the willingness to explore issues that matter deeply to us. <strong>This magazine is a product of our shared curiosity, commitment, and creativity.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                      
                        As STEM students, we are often immersed in logic, analysis, and technical concepts. tutu-B gave us a space to connect those academic skills with real-life applications, personal values, and social relevance. Through this magazine, we learned how to communicate ideas in a way that resonates with others. We discovered how to take complex topics and present them in a form that is both accessible and thought-provoking. <strong>It allowed us to combine facts with emotion, and data with purpose.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                      
                        Our hope is that tutu-B becomes more than just a digital publication. <strong>We want it to be a space where readers feel connected, inspired, and informed.</strong> Whether you are a fellow student, a teacher, or someone simply curious about what we have to say, we invite you to explore this magazine with an open mind. Thank you for joining us on this journey. <strong>We are proud of what we’ve created, and even more excited about where we can go from here.</strong>
                      </p>

                <section class="Article_Section Mission">
                    <h3 class="Article_Section_Header">Our Mission</h3>
                    <p class="Article_Section_Paragraph">
                        <strong>At tutu-B, our mission is to spark curiosity, foster critical thinking, and promote meaningful expression through the fusion of science, creativity, and collaboration.</strong>
                        <br><br>
                      
                        We believe that education should be more than just absorbing facts. It should inspire students to engage with real-world issues, ask questions that matter, and discover their own voice in the process. tutu-B was created as a space where learning is not only academic, but also personal. We wanted to take the knowledge we’ve gained in the classroom and turn it into something that can start conversations, challenge ideas, and connect people.
                        <br><br>
                      
                        tutu-B gives us the opportunity to see STEM through a broader lens—one that includes emotion, ethics, culture, and creativity. It’s where formulas meet values, and where innovation is seen not just as invention, but as impact. We believe that science and technology are at their best when they are used to understand the world more deeply and to help improve it. Every piece in this magazine reflects that belief, combining information with purpose.
                        <br><br>
                      
                        This mission is not just about producing content. It’s about growth, discovery, and collaboration. Behind every article, there are hours of teamwork, research, revision, and reflection. Through tutu-B, we’ve learned how to communicate more clearly, think more critically, and work more closely with each other. We’ve also learned that our voices—though young—have the power to shape perspectives and spark change.
                        <br><br>
                      
                        <strong>Our hope is that this magazine becomes more than a school project. We want it to be a platform where students can express who they are, what they care about, and how they see the world.</strong> By sharing our thoughts, our questions, and our discoveries, we aim to show that learning doesn’t end at the classroom door—it continues wherever there is curiosity, creativity, and courage.

                        <p class="Article_Section_Paragraph">
                            <strong>We envision a future where STEM is accessible, inclusive, and transformative—empowering individuals from all backgrounds to explore, learn, and innovate with confidence and purpose.</strong>
                            <br><br>
                          
                            At tutu-B, we believe that science and technology should not be confined to laboratories or classrooms. They should be tools for progress that reflect the diversity of those who use them. Our vision is rooted in the idea that everyone—regardless of identity, background, or experience—deserves the opportunity to engage with STEM and discover how it connects to the real world. We want to help make that vision possible, starting with this magazine.
                            <br><br>
                          
                            tutu-B represents our belief in an educational experience that is collaborative, creative, and grounded in empathy. It is a space where students are encouraged to think independently, contribute openly, and value different points of view. We imagine a future where platforms like this are not the exception, but the norm—where young people lead conversations, raise awareness, and build bridges between ideas, communities, and cultures.
                            <br><br>
                          
                            <strong>We aim to continue using tutu-B as a platform for growth—not just academically, but personally and socially.</strong> Through storytelling, research, and visual expression, students have the chance to discover what they stand for and how they want to make a difference. We want tutu-B to evolve into a long-lasting example of what student-led, purpose-driven collaboration can achieve when given the space to flourish.
                            <br><br>
                          
                            As we look to the future, we remain committed to nurturing a culture of curiosity, compassion, and excellence. <strong>We believe that every learner has something valuable to contribute, and we hope tutu-B inspires others to step forward, speak up, and take part in building a more informed, creative, and connected world.</strong>
